# GCMT
A tool to download the entire moment tensor catalog of the Global CMT Project.

This Python code was developed under Python 3, but should also run under Python 2. It parses the search results from https://www.globalcmt.org to a Pandas dataframe which can be either used directly in Python or saved to a text file. The included catalog contains 59,677 moment tensors for the years 1976-2021.

This code can be freely distributed with a reference to this GitHub project.
